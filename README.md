# PortfolioProject-2-Amazon-Data-Scraping

For my portfolio project, I embarked on a data analysis journey to extract insightful information from Amazon's vast product database to aid in selecting the most suitable tennis racquet. As an avid recreational tennis player, I aimed to identify the top-selling and relevant racquets to make an informed purchase decision.

Using Python, I leveraged web scraping techniques to gather data related to tennis racquets from Amazon's website. I collected information such as product names, brands, prices, ratings, and customer reviews for tennis racquets that appear in the first 5 search pages on Amazon. The data was then further filtered to remove any non-racquet products and products aimed at a different demographic (such as racquets for children). By analyzing this data, I gained valuable insights into the popularity and performance of different racquets.

Through thorough exploration and visualization of the extracted data, I identified the best-selling racquets and considered factors like customer ratings and feedback to assess their suitability for my needs. This comprehensive analysis empowered me to narrow down my options and make an informed decision based on real-world data.

By documenting this data analysis project on GitHub, I hope to showcase my skills in data extraction, manipulation, and analysis using Python. This project not only demonstrates my passion for tennis but also highlights my ability to utilize data-driven insights to make informed choices.

1. The first analysis looks at the approach to capturing Product details from a single product page and then storing it in a CSV file.

2. In Analysis 2, we look at how URLs for multiple product listings on the Amazon search page can be captured and stored in a list. After capturing multiple URLs we then iterate through each product page to capture product details. In this analysis, we are only capturing product URLs from a single page of the listing.

3. Analysis 3 focuses on looping through multiple pages of product listings and capturing the product details. The code is also organized and cleaned in this file.

4. A dynamic dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize the scraped and processed data to analyze and compare various tennis racquets available on Amazon.
