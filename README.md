# PortfolioProject-2-Amazon-Data-Scraping

For my portfolio project, I embarked on a data analysis journey to extract insightful information from Amazon's vast product database to aid in selecting the most suitable tennis racquet. As an avid recreational tennis player, I aimed to identify the top-selling and relevant racquets to make an informed purchase decision.

Using Python, I leveraged web scraping techniques to gather data related to tennis racquets from Amazon's website. I collected information such as product names, prices, ratings, and customer reviews. By analyzing this data, I gained valuable insights into the popularity and performance of different racquets.

Through thorough exploration and visualization of the extracted data, I identified the best-selling racquets and considered factors like customer ratings and feedback to assess their suitability for my needs. This comprehensive analysis empowered me to narrow down my options and make an informed decision based on real-world data.

By documenting this data analysis project on GitHub, I hope to showcase my skills in data extraction, manipulation, and analysis using Python. This project not only demonstrates my passion for tennis but also highlights my ability to utilize data-driven insights to make informed choices.
